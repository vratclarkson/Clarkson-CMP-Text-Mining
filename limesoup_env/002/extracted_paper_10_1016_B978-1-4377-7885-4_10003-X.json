  "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the laser particle removal applications in the semiconductor industry. In the laser techniques, a laser beam with short pulse duration is used as a source of energy for nanoparticle detachment. In the case of particles with nanometer-scale characteristic diameters, the intermolecular forces dominate many other forces, especially those that are proportional to the volume (e.g., inertia and gravity) and surface (e.g., hydrodynamic and electrostatic forces) of the particle. As the feature size in nano-manufacturing is continuing to shrink and the number of particles on a surface to be removed is decreasing, the re-deposition-free particle removal requirements are inevitably becoming more stringent as yield remains a critical concern in nano-manufacturing, such as in the semiconductor industry. Advances in nanotechnology products have also been driving nano-particle removal research and development. The most common cleaning techniques employed in various high technology industries include brush scrubbing, ultrasonic and megasonic cleaning, centrifugal spray cleaning, vapor phase cleaning, fluid jet cleaning, and cryogenic cleaning. These techniques are often effectively employed for removal of large numbers of micro/nano-scale particles when particle re-deposition is not an issue. The major concerns of the current wet cleaning techniques with respect to semiconductor substrates are threefold: (i) material loss; (ii) contamination issues due to chemical residues (e.g., haze defects); and (iii) possibility of damage to features present elsewhere from the particle defects on the substrate, since conventional cleaning processes target the entire substrate; in other words, precision cleaning is not possible.",
