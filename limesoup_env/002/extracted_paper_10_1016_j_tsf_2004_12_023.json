    "Introduction": "1\n                  Introduction\n                  Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is well applied to the semiconductor device manufacturing. [1] It is a process combining the physical and chemical forces. The former comes from abrasives in slurry. The later refers to the surface modification for a polished film. Many parameters are contributed to CMP, which include abrasive and chemicals of slurry, pad, and force loaded on and relative speed applied to a polishing film. [2] In this article, the effect of abrasives was discussed.\n                  There are three ways to approach the description of CMP. The first one is the empirical equation called Preston's equation. [3] In Preston' equation, the polishing rate(RR) is described as RR=KPV, in which P is the pressure applied to the polished wafer, V is the relative velocity between the polishing pad and the polished wafer wafer surface, and K is called “Preston's coefficient”. The second one is the mechanical approach. The model of Luo and Dornfeld [4] was based on the solid–solid contact mechanism with some assumptions such as periodic roughness of the pad surface, plastic deformation over wafer–particle and pad–particle interfaces, and normalized distribution of abrasive particle size. The third way is the chemical kinetics approach proposed first by Cook [3]. Cook's theory will be discussed later in this article.\n                  Mixed-abrasive slurries were first proposed by Babu et al. [5] They filed a patent with a title of “Chemical–Mechanical Polishing” to the United State Patent and Trade Mark Office on Sep. 13, 2001 and had its application no. 09/950,612 and publication no. US 2003/0047710 A1on Mar. 13, 2003. They presented two types of mixed-abrasive slurry. One is alumina–ceria slurry for oxide CMP, and the other is alumina–silica for metal CMP. From the same research group, Jindal et al. [6] presented the CMP study of the alumina–ceria-typed mixed-abrasive slurry.\n                  According to their experimental discovery, in this article, we will use the methodology of chemical kinetics to describe the mixed-abrasive slurry CMP and propose a polishing rate equation in accord with the chemical kinetics mechanism.",
    "Chemical kinetics model setup": "2\n                  Chemical kinetics model setup\n                  As mentioned above, the chemicals in slurry modifies a polished film, and the abrasives polished the modified film. Both of these phenomena should be considered as chemical reactions. If this view is accepted, then the methodology of chemical kinetics can be applied. The methodology is illustrated as follows. [7] First a mechanism should be proposed as many sequential or parallel steps. These steps give several forward or reversible chemical reactions. For each chemical reaction, one rate equation can be written. Then, with some assumptions of some elements appearing in a very short time, some rate equations can become equal equations. Finally, only one rate equation remains as a combination of the concentration terms and reaction or equilibrium constants.\n                  Furthermore, according to Jairath et al. [8], it is known that with no pad conditioning the polishing rate will decay exponentially as the number of polished wafers increases. Also, referring to Hernandez et al. [9], the adhesion of abrasives in some pad voids for the cases of (i) soaked in slurry only and (ii) soaked and polished was observed. Even in the case of (iii) soaked, polished, and dressed, no slurry was shown. It is believed that pad aging happens during CMP. Thus, there should be a role of a pad in the CMP mechanism.\n                  Chen et al. [1] is the first to develop a chemical kinetics model for CMP through considering a pad as a sort of catalyst. The model is called the catalytic-pad chemical kinetics (represented by CPCK) model. Their model is based on the concept of Cook. [3] Cook [3] proposed the role of chemistry in glass polishing. He suggested that there were five steps in glass polishing including: (1) movement of solvent into the surface layer under the load imposed by the polishing particle; (2) surface dissolution under load; (3) adsorption of dissolution products onto the surface of the polished particle; (4) the rate of back-deposition of dissolution products onto the surface; (5) surface dissolution which occurs between particle impacts. Obviously, Cook [3] didn't concern the pad effect. Therefore, following the ideal of Chen et al. [1], in the later development of the mechanism, a pad was treated as a catalyst.\n                  Jindal et al. [6] studied the alumina–ceria-typed mixed-abrasive slurry. In that system, the alumina abrasives are a large size, and the ceria abrasives are a relatively small size. The TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) images from their work showed that an alumina abrasive was surrounded by many ceria abrasives. Fig. 1(b) illustrated the state of the slurry.\n                  Therefore, we proposed a mechanism as follows. In Fig. 1(a), a mixed-abrasive slurry is sprayed onto a pad and then flows into a region below a polished wafer. As the slurry reaches the polishing region, the region should be separated into the sub-region for non-CMP and the sub-region for CMP. As long as the slurry stays in the non-CMP sub-region in Fig. 1(b), chemicals in the slurry flows onto the wafer surface to change the surface quality for CMP, and simultaneously the large abrasives and the small abrasives have some equilibrium state to achieve the phenomenon. As long as the slurry stays in the CMP sub-region in Fig. 1(c), the large abrasives, the small abrasives, and the joint abrasives adhere onto active sites of the pad or pores of the pad. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1(d) where all types of abrasive are represented as one symbol, these three types of abrasive polish the chemicals-modified wafer surface altogether as a down force is loaded on the wafer. Then, reactions happen between adhering abrasives and active sites of wafer surface (or chemically-modified surface), and materials at the wafer surface are polished. Finally the reacted abrasives will leave the pores or the pad and move into the bulk slurry flow to leave the equipment.\n                  For simplicity, some assumptions should be made as follows: (a)the transportation of fresh or reacted abrasives is fast in a certain time scale such that the mass transfer resistance could be omitted; (b)this mechanism happens in a certain area and thus it is not necessary to take the non-uniformity into consideration; (c)three types of abrasive don't influence each other as adhering onto the active sites of the pad or pores of the pad. Because the experiment of Jindal et al. [6] was for oxide CMP, our mechanism should be confined to oxide CMP, too.\n                  The next step is to write down chemical reactions for the present mechanism. Let's consider the reactions related to Fig. 1(b). Assume the chemicals, large abrasives, small abrasives, joint abrasives, and the polished surface are represented by C, LA, SA, JA, and M (or Mn) respectively. Then, in the surface-modified reaction done by chemicals, the reaction is given as\n                        \n                           (1)\n                           C+M↔CM\n                        \n                     or\n                        \n                           (1-1)\n                           C+M\n                                 n\n                              ↔CM−(M\n                                 n−1)\n                        \n                     C−M or CM−( M\n                        n−1 ) means the active sites of the polished surface. As for the equilibrium reaction of the large abrasives, small abrasives, and joint abrasives, the reaction is given as\n                        \n                           (2)\n                           LA+SA↔JA\n                        \n                     It is assumed that reactions (1), (1-1) and (2) should be a reversible reaction. Reaction 2 doesn't mean one large abrasive (LA) and one small abrasive (SA) react with each other to form one joint abrasive (JA). However, it expresses an idea of the equilibrium of LA, SA and JA in the slurry. According to the results from Jindal et al. [6], one LA reacts with several SAs to form one JA. The structure of JA is assumed to be the same for simplification.\n                  Consider the reactions related to Fig. 1(c). The adhesion reactions of these three type abrasives are given as (assume P represents active sites of the pad or pores)\n                        \n                           (3)\n                           LA+P↔LA−P\n                        \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           (4)\n                           SA+P↔SA−P\n                        \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           (5)\n                           JA+P↔JA−P\n                        \n                     Reactions (3)–(5) are assumed to be a reversible reaction and independent of each other during CMP.\n                  Refer to Fig. 1(d). All adhered abrasives react with the active sites of the polished surface. The polishing reactions are written as\n                        \n                           (6)\n                           LA−P+CM−(M\n                                 n−1)→P−LA−CM+(M\n                                 n-1)\n                        \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           (7)\n                           SA−P+CM−(M\n                                 n−1)→P−SA−CM+(M\n                                 n−1)\n                        \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           (8)\n                           JA−P+CM−(M\n                                 n−1)→P−JA−CM+(M\n                                 n−1)\n                        \n                     Reactions (6)–(8) are assumed to be an irreversible, elementary reaction and independent of each other during CMP.\n                  Finally, the leaving of the reacted abrasives from the pad or pores gives to corresponding reactions as\n                        \n                           (9)\n                           P−LA−CM↔LA−CM+P\n                        \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           (10)\n                           P−SA−CM↔SA−CM+P\n                        \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           (11)\n                           P−JA−CM↔JA−CM+P\n                        \n                     Reactions (9)–(11) are assumed to be a reversible reaction and independent of each other during CMP.",
    "Polishing rate deduction": "3\n                  Polishing rate deduction\n                  The next is to deduce the polishing rate equation for the present mechanism.

Therefore, they are not included in the equilibrium equations.\n                  Finally, for reactions (6)–(8), the rate equation as a whole for these three reactions is written as\n                        \n                           (20)\n                           \n                              R\n                              =\n                              \n                                 k\n                                 6\n                              \n                              ⁢\n                              \n                                 C\n                                 LAP\n                              \n                              ⁢\n                              \n                                 C\n                                 AS\n                              \n                              +\n                              \n                                 k\n                                 7\n                              \n                              ⁢\n                              \n                                 C\n                                 SAP\n                              \n                              ⁢\n                              \n                                 C\n                                 AS\n                              \n                              +\n                              \n                                 k\n                                 8\n                              \n                              ⁢\n                              \n                                 C\n                                 JAP\n                              \n                              ⁢\n                              \n                                 C\n                                 AS\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     In Eq.

Because no specific unit is defined above, a factor, α, is assumed to make R transform to the polishing rate (PR). α should be contributed mainly by the polished area and materials. Therefore, the polishing rate is written as\n                        \n                           (21)\n                           \n                              PR\n                              =\n                              α\n                              \n                                 (\n                                 \n                                    k\n                                    6\n                                 \n                                 ⁢\n                                 \n                                    C\n                                    LAP\n                                 \n                                 ⁢\n                                 \n                                    C\n                                    AS\n                                 \n                                 +\n                                 \n                                    k\n                                    7\n                                 \n                                 ⁢\n                                 \n                                    C\n                                    SAP\n                                 \n                                 ⁢\n                                 \n                                    C\n                                    AS\n                                 \n                                 +\n                                 \n                                    k\n                                    8\n                                 \n                                 ⁢\n                                 \n                                    C\n                                    JAP\n                                 \n                                 ⁢\n                                 \n                                    C\n                                    AS\n                                 \n                                 )\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     or\n                        \n                           (21-1)\n                           \n                              PR\n                              =\n                              α\n                              ⁢\n                              \n                                 C\n                                 AS\n                              \n                              \n                                 (\n                                 \n                                    k\n                                    6\n                                 \n                                 ⁢\n                                 \n                                    C\n                                    LAP\n                                 \n                                 +\n                                 \n                                    k\n                                    7\n                                 \n                                 ⁢\n                                 \n                                    C\n                                    SAP\n                                 \n                                 +\n                                 \n                                    k\n                                    8\n                                 \n                                 ⁢\n                                 \n                                    C\n                                    JAP\n                                 \n                                 )\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  Furthermore, the total sites of the pad or pores is assumed as C\n                     T.

    "Theoretical and experimental discussions": "4\n                  Theoretical and experimental discussions\n                  In Eq. (25), there should be a theoretical conflict that the polishing rate will approach zero if C\n                     C approaches zero. However, C\n                     C should never be zero theoretically. This is because water in the slurry can perform as a kind of chemical for activating the wafer surface. According to Cook [3], water should hydrate oxide film. Thus, the polishing rate will be small or quite small, but not zero even though there is no such “chemical” in the slurry.\n                  As for C\n                     T, it is believed that C\n                     T will gradually decay as the polishing time is increasing. Many factors effect the decay of C\n                     T, such as pad properties, operational parameters (force on the polished wafer, rotational speed, and so on), and slurry properties. Because the present mechanism is based on considering a pad as a sort of catalyst, the form of C\n                     T may be, if the original or after-conditioning sites of a pad is assumed to be C\n                     T0, C\n                     T0(1+αe\n                        βt\n                     ) or C\n                     T0(1+γt\n                     \n                        δ\n                     ) or any forms as applied in the field of catalytic chemistry, where t means the polishing time and α, β, γ, and δ mean some system parameters reflecting the factors.\n                  If there is only one type of abrasive in the slurry, Eq.

However, a theoretical conflict arises that whether or not the polishing rate decreases, after reaching the maximum C\n                     WSA0, with the increase of the concentration of C\n                     WSA0. Because the experimental data doesn't cover that region, it is not sure. If this happens, maybe another mechanism shall come out to explain it.\n                  Actually, with the same data of the items 3–6, PR can be −0.3086CSA0\n                     3−3.9444CWSA0\n                     2+74.611CWSA0+92(R\n                     2=1). In order to match the mathematic form, Eq.

It should be mentioned again that Eq. (30) does not mean one large abrasive and two small abrasives combined to form a joint abrasive. Therefore, following the same deduction method, Eq. (29) may become a form like PR=dC\n                     WSA0\n                     3+eC\n                     WSA0\n                     2+fC\n                     WSA0+g, where g is a parameter for fitting.\n                  According to the data from Babu et al. [5], it might show that the polishing rate would reach a constant as the increase of C\n                     WSA0. The polishing rate of ceria abrasives is low, but it increases dramatically by adding alumina abrasives. For example, the polishing rate at 1.5 wt.% of ceria increases from 7 to 194 nm/min by adding 1.5 wt.% of alumina; the polishing rate at 6.0 wt.% of ceria increases from 12 to 331 nm/min by adding 1.5 wt.% of alumina. Because the added amount of alumina abrasives is 1.5 wt.% for their four data, the phenomenon of the polishing rate increase can be considered as the catalytic effect of ceria on alumina–abrasive CMP. Therefore, based on the TEM pictures of Jindal et al. [6], the main reason for the phenomenon may be described as follows. The size of alumina abrasives is larger than that of ceria abrasives, so the size gives a lot of efforts for the polishing rate. However, ceria is more active than alumina to react an oxide film. When these two kinds of abrasives are mixed together, the ceria abrasives adhere on the surface of an alumina abrasive, it leads to more active alumina-like abrasives (alumina with ceria thereon), and finally, the polishing rate increases.\n                  It should be noted that the present model does not control the total concentration of both abrasives in the slurry and according to the data [5] the weight percentages for both abrasives are small. Thus, the present model should have a further assumption that the weight change of any abrasive does not effect the slurry density.\n                  In view of the empirical and mechanical approaches, the operational parameters such as the pressure (P) applied to the wafer and relative speed (V) are focused on. For example, with an analytic model, Tseng and Wang [10] showed that PR=CP\n                     5/6\n                     V\n                     1/2, and with the role of particle adhesion and surface deformation, Zhang and Busnaina [11] presented PR=C(PV)1/2. However, because a pad should age during the CMP process, the stable control of the operational parameters may not promise a stable polishing rate. Thus, the chemical approach is necessary and the polishing rate equation would be in terms of the abrasive concentration. According to our previous [1] and present studies, some polishing rate equations were proposed. An idea is given, that the stability of the polishing rate would be controlled by adjusting the abrasive concentration.",
    "Conclusion": "5\n                  Conclusion\n                  For the alumina–ceria–mixed slurry presented by Babu et al. [5], it showed the enhancement for the polishing rate. Thus, this type slurry may be prospective in the future for industrial use. Because the composition of slurry is a major effect for this system, it is necessary to develop a polishing rate equation including the concentration term.\n                  In this article, a chemical kinetics mechanism was proposed for the mixed-abrasive CMP system. Following the methodology of chemical kinetics, one polishing rate equation was deduced. With the experimental data from Babu et al. [5], the semi-theoretical polishing rate equation can accord with the experimental equation from the polynomial regression. However, there are several assumptions such as the non-interactions between different abrasives, no consideration of abrasive agglomeration, and so on. It will be the further research subjects for more complex mechanisms."
