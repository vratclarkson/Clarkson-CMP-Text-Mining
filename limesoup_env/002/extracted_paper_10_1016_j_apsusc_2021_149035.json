  "abstract": "Ceria removal during the STI post-CMP cleaning process has recently become a serious concern to the semiconductor industries. It is known that ceria forms a strong Ce-O-Si bonding with the oxide surface that causes the difficulty in ceria removal. In this study, the bond formation and their removal were studied by polishing the oxide surface at pH 4 and pH 8 conditions, i.e. the pH of commercially formulated slurries. Ceria removal mechanisms were investigated through the use of different physical cleaning methods (megasonic and brush scrubbing) and chemical cleaning solutions such as standard cleaning solution 1 (SC1, a mixture solution of NH4OH, H2O2 and H2O), sulfuric acid, and hydrogen peroxide mixture (SPM), and diluted HF (DHF). It was found that ceria particles were removed easily at pH 4 polishing conditions as the electrostatic attraction is dominant than Ce-O-Si bond formation. However, at pH 8 conditions, particles were not removed due to strong bond formation. Only DHF and SPM cleaning conditions were able to remove the ceria particles due to the strong undercutting of oxide and dissolution of ceria particles, respectively. SPM could be the better choice as DHF would cause the surface roughness issues.",

    "Introduction": "1\n                  Introduction\n                  Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) has been a critical process used for global planarization of a variety of surfaces in the semiconductor manufacturing technology of below 10 nm nodes [1–4]. Meeting the stringent requirements for CMP and minimizing CMP induced defects has been of great interest to the overall success of the CMP process [5]. Particles remaining on the wafer surface after the CMP process can cause local roughness that will block subsequent photolithography and lead to pinholes in the deposited film [5]. Hence, understanding the adhesion and removal of nanoparticles that persist on the wafer surface after CMP is a very important aspect to consider in post CMP cleaning [6].\n                  Ceria slurries are widely used in Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) CMP process due to their high selectivity. Ceria actively removes overburdened SiO2 while stopping at the nitride layer [7–12]. To understand the interaction of ceria and silica during CMP, the “chemical tooth’ model has been proposed by Cook [13]. According to this model, ceria would exist as Ce-OH2\n                     + at lower pH values and in the form of Ce-OH or Ce-O- at higher pH values. Material removal from the surface of silica during the polishing process is attributed to the temporary attachment of ceria to the silica surface due to the change in ceria surface charge characteristics at different pH conditions concerning its pH at point of zero charge (pHpzc ~ 6–7) as follows [13]:\n                        \n                           (1)\n                           Ce-OH2\n                              + ↔ Ce-OH + H+, pH < pHpzc\n                           \n                        \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           (2)\n                           Ce-OH ↔ Ce-O- + H+, pH > pHpzc\n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  Silica also exists in the form of Si-OH2\n                     + and Si-OH/Si-O- at lower and higher pH values, respectively as shown by Eqs. (3) and (4) [13,14].\n                        \n                           (3)\n                           Si-OH2\n                              ++ H2O ↔ Si-OH + H3O+, pKa1 = 0.2\n                        \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           (4)\n                           Si-OH + H2O ↔ Si-O-+ H3O+, pKa2 = 5.4\n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  At pH values below the pHpzc of ceria particles, the surface of ceria becomes positively charged. Therefore, the interaction between a positively charged ceria surface and the anionic silica species (SiO(OH)3\n                     -) occurs as\n                        \n                           (5)\n                           Ce-OH2\n                              + + (HO)Si-(OH)2\n                              - ↔ Ce-O-SiO(OH)2\n                              - + H3O+\n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  Ce-OH2\n                     + and Si-OH are dominant at acidic pH on ceria and oxide surface respectively. So, it is difficult to form a Ce-O-Si bond at pH below pHpzc. Even if a Ce-O-Si bond is formed, it may be unstable due to ceria oxidation (Ce3+ to Ce4+) in the presence of protons at acidic pH.\n                  Above pH 6, ceria surface is negatively charged and, in principle, silicate uptake can proceed as shown by equation (6):\n                        \n                           (6)\n                           Ce-O- + (HO)Si-(OH)2\n                              - ↔ Ce-O-SiO(OH)2\n                              - + OH–\n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  As pH increases the production of Ce-O-SiO(OH)2\n                     - is favored that enhances silicate adsorption providing strong Ce-O-Si bonding at alkaline pH [15–17]. Hence, with physical forces applied during the polishing process, a strong chemical bond of Ce-O-Si may be anticipated depending on slurry pH.\n                  Several techniques are used to remove residual particles from the wafer after the CMP process. Physical forces resulting from megasonic cleaning and brush scrubbing provide sonication energy and drag force, respectively, to help the removal of contamination particles. Megasonic cleaning uses acoustic streaming and cavitation as a particle lifting force. In megasonic cleaning, cavitation collapses near the surface and bubble microstreaming also provides shear force for particle removal. Optimization of megasonic frequency, cleaning time, and solution temperature, etc. could improve the cleaning efficiency [18–21]. PVA brush scrubbing is the most commonly used method for post CMP cleaning applications in which direct mechanical ‘‘wiping’’ by shear force lifts the particles from the wafer surface [10,22,23]. Shear forces applied are inversely proportional to the radius of the particle, as smaller particles are more difficult to clean off compared to the bigger ones.\n                  Chemical cleaners are widely adopted for effectively removing smaller size abrasive particles from surfaces. Dilute hydrofluoric acid (DHF) and ammonium hydroxide based chemistries (SC1) are used to remove ceria particles by slightly etching the silicon oxide surface and by minimizing the electrostatic attraction between slurry particles and wafer surfaces due to the highly acidic and alkaline natures of the cleaning solutions, respectively [24–27]. Sulfuric acid in the form of SPM (H2SO4:H2O2, 2:1 to 4:1) actively dissolves ceria particles attached to the oxide surface [22,28]. Seo et al. showed the effect of chemistry in effectively removing smaller size colloidal ceria particles [29]. In their study, they presented equimolar solutions containing H2O2 and either NH4OH or KOH, aided by ultrasonic cleaning, and at high pH, as almost completely removing even 10 nm-sized colloidal ceria particles from silicon dioxide surfaces. Earlier researchers carried out ceria cleaning work, however, they did not consider the effect of the polishing process on ceria contamination and its bonding with oxide surface [27,30]. Just dipping into ceria slurries for contamination evaluation might result in different natures of ceria particle attachment to oxide [31].\n                  In this work, we have studied the effect of different cleaning forces on ceria particle removal from silica (TEOS) substrate. Silica and ceria interactions were studied in detail to propose a suitable cleaning mechanism with standard physical cleaning methods such as megasonic and brush scrubbing, as well as with conventional cleaning chemistries (SC1, SPM, and DHF). To the best of our knowledge, no elaborated study yet exists that summarizes and compares the cleaning mechanisms for ceria particles after polishing with consideration for particle nature at different pH values by these widely used cleaning methods. The objective of this study is to evaluate post CMP cleaning of ceria particles strongly bound to the TEOS surface. Wafer samples polished with pH 4 and pH 8 ceria slurry were used for cleaning experiments. Ceria removal mechanisms were interrogated by the effects of different physical and chemical cleaning methods.",
    "Experimental": "2\n                  Experimental\n                  2.4 μm thick TEOS (Tetraethyl orthosilicate) deposited on a 300 mm Si substrate was used for the experiments. Wafers were sliced into 4 × 4 cm2 coupons for CMP polishing experiments with ceria slurries. 100 nm calcined ceria particles (US Research Nanomaterials Inc., USA) were used at 0.1 wt% concentration in deionized water (DIW) to prepare ceria slurries (without additives). The pH of the slurries was adjusted to 4 and 8 by using HNO3 or KOH, respectively. CMP experiments were carried out on a friction polisher (Poli-500, GNP Tech., Korea) with an IC1000 polishing pad (Dow Electronic Materials, USA) at 3 psi pressure and 60/40 rpm (head/platen) speed. The flow rate of the ceria slurry was maintained at 150 ml/min and polishing was performed for 60 s to induce sufficient ceria contamination. After polishing, the contaminated samples were rinsed with DI water to remove loosely attached ceria particles and dried using N2. After contamination, each coupon was further sliced into 2 × 2 cm2 for cleaning experiments due to the ease and compatibility of the cleaning equipment. For each data, the contaminants were carefully observed using FE-SEM and distinctively counted the particle count. No foreign particles were found in the inspected area.\n                  Different physical (brush/megasonic) and chemical (SC1, SPM, and DHF) cleaning methods were employed to study the effect of the cleaning process on ceria removal. The megasonic cleaning effect was evaluated using a commercial single wafer megasonic cleaner (Akrion Systems LLC, USA). Polished coupons were attached to the dummy wafer as shown in Fig. 1\n                      (a) and the cleaning condition was optimized to 30-watt power, 0.83 MHz frequency, 600 ml/min flow rate of DI water, and 60 s cleaning time. A lab designed nodule type brush set up as shown in Fig. 1 (b) was used to evaluate the effect of brush scrubbing on ceria cleaning. Nodules were cut from a commercial 200 mm PVA brush (AION Co. Ltd., Japan) using a custom-made punch and attached to a brush holder for evaluation of ceria cleaning. Brush scrubbing was performed for 20 s at a gap distance of −2 mm with DI water flow rate of 600 ml/min. Wafer and brush rotation was maintained at 160 and 60 rpm, respectively.\n                  Chemical cleaning methods using conventional chemical cleaners such as SC1, SPM, and DHF were used to compare the effect of chemical forces on ceria removal (Fig. 1 (c)). SC1 (NH4OH:H2O2:H2O, 1:1:5) cleaning was performed at 70℃. Polished samples were dipped in SC1 solution for 10 min (if no other time was specified) and ceria removal efficiency was calculated. Similarly, for SPM (H2SO4:H2O2, 4:1 at 90–120 °C) and DHF (HF:DIW, 1:100 at room temperature), polished samples were dipped in the cleaning solutions for 60 s (if no other time was specified) to calculate their cleaning efficiencies. Glass beakers were used for SC1 and SPM solutions, however, Teflon beakers were used for DHF experiments due to glass compatibility issues with DHF. All cleaning experiments were repeated at least 3 times.\n                  Sample surfaces before and after cleaning were analyzed to calculate the particle removal efficiency (PRE, %) values using optical microscopy (Nikon LV-100D, Japan) in the dark field and FE-SEM (MIRA3, -TESCAN). Using optical microscopy (OM), the particles were observed in the dark field at 500× magnification, whereas for FE-SEM, samples were analyzed at 10 and 50 kX magnifications. Image-Pro Plus (IPP 5.1, Media Cybernetics, Inc.) and Image J (Image Processing and Analysis in Java, National Institute of Health, USA) were used for the particle counting from optical microscopy and FE-SEM particle images, respectively. The initial particle count was obtained from the average particle count of several polished wafer coupons analyzed and only a representative data image was depicted for FESEM analysis. In a similar way, each cleaning experiment was repeated at least three times and only representative data was used. PRE was calculated by estimating the particle count before and after cleaning as given by the equation (6):\n                        \n                           (6)\n                           \n                              \n                                 P\n                                 a\n                                 r\n                                 t\n                                 i\n                                 c\n                                 l\n                                 e\n                                 \n                                 R\n                                 e\n                                 m\n                                 o\n                                 v\n                                 a\n                                 l\n                                 \n                                 E\n                                 f\n                                 f\n                                 i\n                                 c\n                                 i\n                                 e\n                                 n\n                                 c\n                                 y\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    (\n                                    P\n                                    R\n                                    E\n                                    ,\n                                    %\n                                    )\n                                 \n                                 =\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          I\n                                          n\n                                          i\n                                          t\n                                          i\n                                          a\n                                          l\n                                          \n                                          C\n                                          e\n                                          r\n                                          i\n                                          a\n                                          \n                                          C\n                                          o\n                                          u\n                                          n\n                                          t\n                                          -\n                                          R\n                                          e\n                                          s\n                                          i\n                                          d\n                                          u\n                                          a\n                                          l\n                                          \n                                          C\n                                          e\n                                          r\n                                          i\n                                          a\n                                          \n                                          C\n                                          o\n                                          u\n                                          n\n                                          t\n                                       \n                                    \n                                    \n                                       I\n                                       n\n                                       i\n                                       t\n                                       i\n                                       a\n                                       l\n                                       \n                                       C\n                                       e\n                                       r\n                                       i\n                                       a\n                                       \n                                       C\n                                       o\n                                       u\n                                       n\n                                       t\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 x\n                                 100\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  Ceria particles contaminated on the TEOS substrate were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-alpha plus, Thermo Scientific, U.S.A.). The XPS experiments were performed in a UHV multipurpose surface analysis system operating at base pressures of <10-9 mbar. The photoelectron spectra were excited by an Al Kα (1486.6 eV) anode operating at a constant power of 200 W. During the spectra acquisition, the constant analyzer energy (CAE) mode was employed at pass energy of 50 eV and a step of 0.1 eV. Three types of spectra were analyzed to study the ceria concentrations; survey spectra (BE: 0–1100 eV), Ce3d core spectra (BE: 877–921 eV), and O1s spectra (BE: 525–530 eV).\n                  Etch rate measurements were carried out by dipping the TEOS coupons of 2 × 2 cm2 size in the respective cleaning solutions (SC1, SPM, DHF) for specific times. The oxide thickness was measured before and after dipping to calculate the etch rates using a reflectometer (ST2000DLXn, K-MAC, Korea).",
    "Results and discussion": "3\n                  Results and discussion\n                  The mechanisms of ceria particle adhesion to the oxide surface by dipping and polishing were investigated in our previous work. It was hypothesized that electrostatic attraction may be more dominant during dipping, however, Ce-O-Si chemical bonding is playing a dominant role in contamination during polishing. The mechanism of ceria and silica interaction during polishing at different pH values of ceria slurry was presented along with the detailed analysis for Ce-O-Si bonding confirmation [16]. Hence to understand the Ce-O-Si bond-breaking only polished samples were used for the cleaning experiments. It was found that ceria adheres more strongly to the oxide surface after polishing with pH 8 ceria slurry than after polishing with pH 4 ceria slurry, which is attributed to the dominant electrostatic attraction at pH 4 and strong Ce-O-Si bond formation at pH 8 [16,17]. It is reported that peroxide would change the oxidation state of ceria (Ce3+ to Ce4+ or Ce4+ to Ce3+) due to the oxidation and reduction process [32,33]. Hence to check the valency effect we added different concentrations of peroxide (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5%) to the pH 4 ceria slurry and found a similar level of contamination (results are not shown here). It shows that at acidic pH conditions, electrostatic attractions would be very dominant as compared to chemical bonding.\n                  To get the ceria-contaminated oxide surfaces, the oxide coupon was polished with a ceria slurry of pH 4 and pH 8. To evaluate the ceria removal mechanism, cleaning processes were categorized as physical and chemical. Contaminated wafers were cleaned using physical methods (PVA brush scrubbing and megasonic cleaning) and conventional chemical cleaners (SC1, DHF, and SPM). Fig. 2\n                     (a-f) shows the FESEM images of different oxide samples before cleaning and after cleaning with different physical and chemical forces. Fig. 2a shows the contaminated oxide coupons polished with pH 4 and pH 8 ceria slurries. It can be observed that pH 8 samples contained higher contamination than pH 4 samples. For pH 8 samples a regular line pattern was observed and these could be attributed to the use of circular groove pattern polishing pads [16,34]. They may allow the ceria particles to get chemical bonding with the oxide surface. However, further study is needed to understand the contamination in line pattern.\n                  Megasonic cleaning was applied in DIW to remove the particles attached to the substrate. Megasonic cleaning time was optimized to obtain a higher PRE. The number of particles on pH 4 and pH 8 polished samples before and after megasonic cleaning and PRE is shown in Fig. 3\n                     . After megasonic cleaning in DIW, pH 4 polished samples did not show complete removal of ceria particles from the oxide surface. Sonic energy provided in megasonic cleaning was inefficient for removing ceria particles attached to the TEOS surface and resulted in a partial cleaning (~55% PRE). Megasonic cleaning performed on pH 8 polished samples removed only large particles. Thousands of particles remained on pH 8 polished TEOS surfaces after megasonic cleaning. Megasonic energy was not effective at all to remove small particles from pH 8 polished samples as shown by Fig. 3. This inefficiency of megasonic cleaning in detaching ceria particles from pH 8 polished oxide surface shows a strong bonding between ceria and oxide. More energy is required than megasonic forces to break these ceria and silica interactions formed by polishing.\n                  FE-SEM images shown in Fig. 2 (b) after the cleaning of pH 4 and pH 8 polished samples confirms the results observed by Fig. 3, i.e., megasonic cleaning results in partial cleaning of pH 4 contaminated samples and has no significant cleaning effect on pH 8 contaminated samples. Fig. 2 (b) and Fig. 3 demonstrate partial megasonic cleaning for pH 4 polished samples and very weak cleaning for pH 8 polished samples. Partial cleaning of pH 4 polished samples could be due to the weak electrostatic attraction between ceria and silica. Lack of significant cleaning of ceria from pH 8 polished samples could be related to strong Ce-O-Si chemical bonding [16]. Megasonic results indicate that the polishing process provides stronger interaction between ceria and silica at pH 8 and energy provided by acoustic cavitation is insufficient to break this strong interaction completely. To detach ceria chemically bound with oxide at pH 8, a higher force is required than the forces provided by megasonic cleaning.\n                  After confirming the inefficiency of non-contact physical forces applied by megasonic cleaning, ceria removal by direct contact brush was studied. Stronger direct brush scrubbing was applied to remove the attached ceria particles from the oxide surfaces of both pH 4 and 8 samples. In brush scrubbing, mechanical wiping of surfaces with PVA brushes provides a direct shear force that lifts the particles from the surface [10,22]. Oxide samples polished with pH 4 and pH 8 ceria slurries were cleaned with the nodule of a PVA brush using a lab-made nodule-type brush scrubber (shown in Fig. 1 b)). Initially, brush scrubbing was performed for 20 s, and samples were analyzed using SEM. Fig. 4\n                      shows the number of particles before and after cleaning and their PRE after brush scrubbing. Brush scrubbing of pH 4 samples resulted in high PRE (99.9%) whereas brush scrubbing of pH 8 samples showed heavy contamination even after brush cleaning with low PRE (30%).\n                  Both pH 4 and pH 8 polished samples were analyzed after brush scrubbing using FE-SEM and the captured images are shown above in Fig. 2 (c). pH 4 samples were efficiently cleaned by scrubbing but no significant cleaning was observed on pH 8 samples suggesting that electrostatically bound ceria particles were easily removed by the drag forces of brushes. However, these brush scrubbing drag forces were unable to break the strongly attached chemically bound ceria (Ce-O-Si) resulting in high particle counts even after brush scrubbing [22–25]. The results of megasonic cleaning and brush scrubbing show that physical cleaning methods using DI water are not sufficient to break Ce-O-Si bonding and remove the ceria contamination from oxide surfaces polished at higher pH.\n                  To study the effect of chemistry in removing ceria particles from an oxide surface, conventional chemical cleaners such as SC1, DHF, and SPM were evaluated. SC1 is a strong alkaline solution that can change the surface charges of both ceria particles and oxide surface to more negative charges, providing electrostatic repulsion between particles and substrate leading to better cleaning [24–27]. SC1 cleaning time was varied to find an optimized condition for removing electrostatically attached ceria particles remained on the oxide surface after polishing with pH 4 ceria slurry. pH 4 polished samples were dipped in SC1 (1:1:5 at 70 °C) for 1, 5, and 10 min. The number of particles that remained after cleaning was estimated by analyzing the samples before and after cleaning using OM. Fig. 5\n                      shows the effect of SC1 cleaning time on PRE of pH 4 polished samples. Samples dipped in SC1 for 1 and 5 min did not show the effective removal of ceria particles whereas the 10 min dipped sample showed ~90% removal of particles; this time was set as the SC1 treatment time. Fig. 6\n                      shows the effect of SC1 cleaning on pH 4 and pH 8 polished samples. As the results indicate that SC1 cleaning was unable to break Ce-O-Si bonds for pH 8 polished samples and no significant difference in particle count was observed after dipping for 10 min in SC1. On the other hand, pH 4 polished samples resulted in very high particle removal efficiency as only a few particles were found after cleaning.\n                  \n                     Fig. 2 (d) shows the FE-SEM images of pH 4 and 8 polished samples after SC1 cleaning. pH 4 polished samples were efficiently cleaned using SC1 with only a few intermittent particles remaining, whereas no effective cleaning was observed for pH 8 polished samples. FE-SEM images obtained after cleaning show the agglomeration of particles after dipping in SC1 for 10 min. These results confirm that while SC1 effectively removes electrostatically attached ceria particles from pH 4 polished samples, it does not remove ceria particles from TEOS wafers polished with pH 8 ceria slurry.\n                  XPS analysis was performed to analyze the effect of SC1 chemistry on ceria removal from the oxide surface. Fig. 7\n                      shows the XPS data obtained before and after SC1 cleaning of pH 4 and pH 8 polished samples including the TEOS sample as a reference. Ceria related survey peaks at binding energy ~850–950 eV are intense for pH 8 polished sample as shown in Fig. 7 (a). These peaks show low intensity for pH 4 polished samples. No peaks were observed for the reference TEOS surface. This shows that ceria adheres stronger at pH 8 than at pH 4. When the samples were cleaned with SC1 chemistry, the ceria peaks of the pH 4 sample disappear but ceria peaks of the pH 8 sample were only a little reduced in intensity. Ceria was therefore removed effectively for pH 4 samples by SC1 cleaning but not significantly for pH 8 samples as confirmed by FE-SEM (Fig. 2 (d)). O1s spectra given in Fig. 7 (b) were analyzed to confirm the presence of Ce-O-Si bonding. Munusamy et al., also reported the presence of a ceria-related peak at ~530 eV representing the formation of Ce-O-Si bonding [35]. A detailed explanation about correlating Ce-O-Si bonding with the XPS peak at ~529 can be found in our previous work [16]. This Ce-O-Si bonding peak was evident for pH 8 samples after polishing whereas the same peak intensity was very low for pH 4 polished samples. The slight bonding present in pH 4 samples was completely removed by cleaning with SC1. There was no bond breaking effect observed using SC1 cleaning as Ce-O-Si bonding was still evident after SC1 cleaning of pH 8 polished samples.\n                  DHF is a strongly acidic solution in post CMP cleaning that can be used to remove contaminant particles by etching oxide surface through an undercut mechanism [22,27]. The effect of DHF concentration on the etching of oxide was tested by dipping blanket TEOS wafer coupons in 1:10 to 1:1,000 dilutions of HF. Ceria particle removal efficiency of different DHF concentrations is shown in Fig. 8\n                     . The etch rate decreases at higher DHF dilution ratios. Oxide polished coupon samples with pH 4 and pH 8 slurries were dipped in different DHF concentrations for 60 s. PRE was correlated with the etch rate obtained at different DHF concentrations. DHF undercuts the oxide surface to which the ceria particles were attached. Particle count and PRE were measured by OM to find an optimized condition for DHF cleaning. Ceria particle cleaning efficiency and etch rate increased with increasing HF concentration. No ceria particles were removed with highly diluted HF such as 1:500 to 1:1000 since no etching occurred either at such dilute concentrations. The etching of the silicon oxide surface resulted in removing chemically bound ceria particles from the oxide surface. Cleaning efficiency of ~99% was obtained with 1:100 dilutions of DHF by etching of silicon oxide surface ~7 nm.\n                  XPS analysis was performed to confirm Ce-O-Si bond removal as a function of DHF concentration. Fig. 9\n                      (a) and (b) show the survey and O1s spectra of pH 8 polished samples treated in different concentrations of DHF. Survey spectra show the high intensity of ceria without cleaning and its gradual decrease with increasing HF concentration. This decrease in ceria intensity confirms the efficient removal of ceria particles from the oxide surface. PRE data shows that 1:100 DHF results in efficient ceria removal (Fig. 8). The survey spectra obtained after cleaning at this DHF concentration contained no ceria peaks. XPS O1s spectra were obtained to see the effect of different HF concentrations on the removal of Ce-O-Si bonding. Ce-O-Si peak was observed after polishing with pH 8 ceria slurry. The intensity of this peak decreased with increasing HF concentration as etching of the oxide surface detaches the ceria particles from the oxide substrate. This caused the decrease of Ce-O-Si bond intensity as shown in Fig. 9 (b) for 1:500 and 1:1000 ratios of DHF. DHF concentration of 1:100 showed almost complete removal of ceria particles (~99% PRE) by etching the silicon oxide surface and removing Ce-O-Si bonding.\n                  pH 4 and pH 8 polished samples subsequently cleaned by DHF dipping were analyzed using FE-SEM to confirm the effective cleaning of smaller ceria particles from the oxide surface and the results are reported in Fig. 10\n                      and FE-SEM images presented above in Fig. 2 (e). There were no or very few ceria particles found on the surfaces of samples polished with pH 4 and pH 8 ceria slurries after dipping in DHF (1:100) for 60 s. XPS analysis obtained before and after cleaning with DHF confirmed the efficient removal of ceria particles from the oxide surface as no ceria intensity peak was observed in the survey spectrum. The Ce-O-Si bonding peak completely disappeared for pH 8 samples after cleaning with DHF (Fig. 11\n                      (a) and (b)). However, higher undercutting (>7 nm/min) is not preferable that limits the use of DHF concentration to be applied in cleaning.\n                  SPM (H2SO4: H2O2) is a powerful cleaning solution as it can dissolve ceria due to its strong oxidizing ability [22]. SPM chemistry can remove ceria particles whether electrostatically attached or chemically bound by its well-known dissolution mechanism between ceria and sulfuric acid as given by Um et al. [28]:\n                        \n                           (7)\n                           CeO2 + 2H2SO4 → Ce(SO4)2 + 2H2O\n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  The effect of SPM treatment time on cleaning was evaluated by dipping the ceria polished samples in the SPM solution as a function of time. pH 4 and pH 8 polished samples were dipped in H2SO4: H2O2 (4:1) at 90–100 °C for 1 and 10 min. Fig. 12\n                      (a) shows the quantitative data obtained for the number of particles that remained on the wafer after cleaning. Particle count data obtained after 1 and 10 min dipping in SPM shows that nanosize ceria particles were completely dissolved in SPM which indicates the efficiency of SPM in removing ceria for both pH 4 and pH 8 polished samples. Even 1-minute dipping provided very high PRE > 98% and very few particles remained on the oxide surface as shown in Fig. 12 (b).\n                  FE-SEM images obtained after SPM cleaning are shown above in Fig. 2 (f) for pH 4 and pH 8 polished samples, which confirms the effective ceria removal from oxide wafer after cleaning. These results show that all the ceria particles were effectively removed from the oxide substrate and completely cleaned surfaces were obtained after dipping in SPM. Fig. 13\n                      (a) and (b) show the XPS survey peaks and O1s peaks, respectively. These spectrums confirm the effectiveness of SPM dissolution action in removing ceria particles from TEOS. Survey spectra demonstrate efficient ceria removal as ceria intensity reduced to zero, whereas the absence of Ce-O-Si bonding peak after SPM cleaning in O1s peak indicates the efficient removal of Ce-O-Si bonding after dipping of polished samples in SPM.\n                  To investigate the role of oxide etch rate in removing ceria particles, TEOS oxide etch rates were measured for SC1, SPM, and DHF as shown in Fig. 14\n                     . A slight etching was observed for SC1, whereas no etching was found for SPM treated samples A higher etching rate (7 nm/min) was found for DHF, showing that the etching is the key mechanism for DHF cleaning but not for other chemical cleaners (SC1 and SPM). Hence SPM could remove strongly adhered ceria particles (pH 8 polished) purely by dissolving the ceria particles and without undercutting any oxide surface yielding a clean, non-etched smooth oxide surface.\n                  Results of chemical cleaning are summarized in Table 1\n                      quantitatively by comparing PRE with Ce3+ concentration and Ce-O-Si peak area observed. Ce3d spectra were deconvoluted to calculate Ce3+% [16], whereas the Ce-O-Si peak area was calculated from O1s spectra’s considering peak area for pH 8 polished samples before cleaning as a reference for other conditions. In our previous work, it was reported that polishing with pH 8 ceria slurry resulted in higher Ce3+ % and stronger Ce-O-Si bonding leads to the highest peak area observed after deconvolution [16]. As SC1 was able to remove ceria particles only from pH 4 polished samples (>95% PRE), no Ce3+% was observed after SC1 cleaning, whereas no significant cleaning of pH 8 polished samples as Ce3+ concentration was slightly reduced after SC1 cleaning. Both DHF and SPM effectively removed all ceria particles completely from both pH 4 and pH 8 polished samples therefore no Ce3+ was observed on sample surfaces. Similarly, the reduction in the Ce-O-Si peak area calculated after the deconvolution of O1s spectra confirms the breaking of Ce-O-Si bonding by DHF and SPM. No breaking of Ce-O-Si bonding was observed after SC1 cleaning of pH 8 polished samples and only a slight reduction was observed in the Ce-O-Si peak area.\n                  These results confirm that only SPM and DHF effectively remove all types of ceria (physically or chemically bonded) from the oxide surface. Fig. 15\n                      summarizes possible cleaning mechanisms to remove strongly bound (Ce-O-Si) ceria particles from the oxide surface by different cleaning methods as discussed above. Physical cleaning methods of megasonic and brush scrubbing alone are insufficient for removing Ce-O-Si chemically bound ceria particles. SC1 may provide slight etching and stronger electrostatic repulsion resulting in ceria particle removal from pH 4 polished samples, however, this same electrostatic and etching force is not sufficient for the removal of ceria from pH 8 polished samples. Strong undercutting by etching the substrate using DHF was the dominant mechanism in cleaning silicon oxide surfaces. SPM efficiently dissolved ceria particles from oxide surfaces polished with both pH 4 and pH 8 ceria slurries. So, in comparison, acidic chemicals providing dissolution or undercutting such as SPM and DHF offer effective removal of ceria particles rather than the zeta potential change offered by SC1, especially when the ceria particles are chemically bound to the substrate. SPM may be the better choice as it removes chemically bonded ceria completely without any undercutting. Hence, it is very important to consider the type of ceria slurry i.e. ceria particle size and shape, which can affect ceria and silicon oxide interactions, when choosing a suitable post CMP cleaning method for effective ceria cleaning from silicon oxide surface.",
    "Conclusions": "4\n                  Conclusions\n                  Ceria contamination during STI post CMP cleaning is a big concern. Ceria cleaning was studied by physical and chemical cleaning methods after polishing TEOS samples with pH 4 and 8 ceria slurries. Physical cleaning forces proved to be somewhat effective for removing electrostatically bound ceria particles of pH 4 polished samples but no significant cleaning effect was observed for chemically bonded (Ce-O-Si) ceria particles on pH 8 polished samples, showing that physical forces alone do not remove strongly attached ceria particles from the oxide surface. Different cleaning chemicals were used to remove ceria particles such as SC1, DHF, and SPM. SC1 did not show any bond breaking capacity for ceria particles chemically bound to pH 8 samples. SC1 was only effective for removing ceria particles from pH 4 polished samples. Strongly acidic chemical cleaners such as SPM and DHF effectively disrupted strong Ce-O-Si bonding and effectively removed all the ceria particulate contamination from the oxide surface by dissolution and undercutting mechanisms, respectively. SPM may be the better choice as it dissolves chemically bonded ceria particles without any undercutting of the oxide surface. Acidic cleaning chemicals are therefore found most suitable for removing ceria particles during post-CMP cleaning.",
