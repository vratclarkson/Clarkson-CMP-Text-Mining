  "abstract": "The reaction between lanthanum-gallate electrolyte and Ni in the anode often occurs during the co-firing of an anode-supported cell and results in the degradation of cell performance. In this study, a thick-film LSGM (La0.9Sr0.1\n                     Ga0.8\n                     Mg0.2O3-δ) electrolyte-supported micro-cell was fabricated and electrochemically tested to see the effects of the anode-firing temperature on the SOFC performance. The LSGM tape (~20μm-thick) was sintered and then mounted on a LSGM cylindrical-ring (~400μm-thick) by sintering two pieces together at 1500°C. NiO-GDC (Gd-doped ceria) slurries were brush painted for the anode on the bottom surface of the supporting LSGM electrolyte and the electrolyte/anode layers were subsequently fired at 1300, 1350, 1375 or 1400°C, respectively. SSC (Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3−δ\n                     ) slurries were also brush painted for cathode on the opposite side and the cathode/electrolyte/anode layers were fired at 900°C. The cell with the anode sintered at 1300°C showed the highest performance (OCV ~1.1V, Pmax or maximum power density ~0.93W/cm2 at 700°C). The increase of the anode-firing temperature reduced the cell performance. Although the anode fired at 1375°C showed a reduced OCV (~0.90V at 700°C), the cell performance was still high (Pmax: ~0.55W/cm2 at 700°C). The cell with the anode fired at 1400°C showed the lowest OCV (~0.27V). The open-circuit voltage (OCV) and thus the performance of the cells were largely dependent upon the anode-firing temperature since the reaction of Ni with the LSGM electrolyte induces an electronic conduction in the LSGM electrolyte which then decreases the OCV.",

    "Introduction": "1\n                  Introduction\n                  Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is one of the most realistic candidates for a new power generation system due to its high efficiency and great fuel flexibility [1,2]. However, SOFC still has many technical problems related to its high operating temperature (800–1000°C). Recently SOFCs operating in the intermediate temperature range (500–700°C) have received great attention since the use of metallic interconnects and long-term stability can be realized [3,4]. Strontium- and magnesium-doped lanthanum-gallate (La1−xSrxGa1−yMgyO3−δ\n                     ) was proposed as a candidate electrolyte at the intermediate temperature use due to its higher ionic conductivity than yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and its negligible electronic conductivity in a wide oxygen partial-pressure (Po2) range [5,6].\n                  In a composite anode, Ni is still the most popular component for SOFCs using the LSGM electrolyte. The activity and stability of Ni are very sensitive to the preparation process due to the interaction between Ni and the LSGM electrolyte. Although the cermet anode containing Ni is a promising material for the LSGM-based SOFC, the reaction between Ni and LSGM during the anode fabrication and the cell operation leads to a substantial loss in the anode performance [7,8]. A number of reports have been made for the interfacial reaction between a Ni-based anode and a LSGM electrolyte in the thick (thickness>~150μm) electrolyte-supported SOFCs [9–11]. The interfacial reaction increases with the anode-firing temperature. The diffusion of Ni into LSGM produces a highly resistive phase. Thus buffer layers such as the La-doped ceria were often used in order to minimize the reaction in the anode-supported cells that use the LSGM electrolyte [12,13]. The effects of the anode-firing temperature on the performance of the LSGM cell may be better understood by using the LSGM-supported micro-cell due to its thin-electrolyte layer (thickness ~20μm) and the simplicity of the cell structure.\n                  We have previously designed and tested an electrolyte-supported SOFC using the LSGM film (~20μm thick) which shows a high power density [14]. A novel experimental setup, using a ring to support a thick-film electrolyte, made the measurement of power density possible for an electrolyte as thin as ~20μm [15,16]. In this novel design, the LSGM electrolyte and the anode were not co-fired and thus, the temperatures of electrolyte sintering and anode firing were controlled independently. Although the cell was electrolyte-supported, the maximum power density (Pmax) of the cell was comparable to the best-reported performance of the anode-supported SOFCs that use the LSGM electrolyte [14]. This setup can be useful to determine the optimum co-firing temperature of the anode-supported cell or to test the effects of the anode-firing temperature on the performance of the LSGM-electrolyte film-based cell. In this study, we have studied the effects of the firing temperature of a Ni-GDC anode on the performance of the LSGM thick-film electrolyte-supported cell. Electrochemical measurements were used to test the performance of the single cell.",
    "Experimental procedure": "2\n                  Experimental procedure\n                  LSGM (La0.9Sr0.1\n                     Ga0.8\n                     Mg0.2O3-δ) powder was prepared by using a solid-state reaction method. A stoichiometric amount of La2O3 (99.99%, Strem Chemicals, USA), SrCO3 (99.9%, High Purity Chemicals, Japan), Ga2O3 (99.9%, High Purity Chemicals, Japan) and MgO (99.9%, High Purity Chemicals, Japan) powders was ball-milled with zirconia balls in ethanol for 12h and calcined at 1200°C for 6h. In order to fabricate the LSGM tape, the powder was mixed and ball-milled for 24h with a solvent and binder solution to produce slurries for tape casting. The LSGM slurry was cast onto a polyethylene carrier-film using a tape caster (lab assembled). The LSGM tapes were cut in a desired shape and sintered at 1500°C for 6h. The sintered LSGM film (~20μm-thick) was mounted on a ~400μm-thick cylindrical-ring made of LSGM by sintering two pieces together at 1500°C for 6h. After mounting a LSGM thick-film on a LSGM ring, the NiO-GDC (Gd-doped ceria, Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ) slurry was brush painted on the bottom surface of the LSGM-electrolyte film. The electrolyte/anode layers were subsequently fired at 1300, 1350, 1375 or 1400°C, respectively, for 3h in air. For cathode coating, SSC (Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3−δ\n                     , NexTech Materials Ltd, USA) powders were mixed with an organic solution and brush painted on the top surface of the electrolyte film. The cell with the cathode/electrolyte/anode layers was fired at 900°C for 2h in air. The active areas of both cathode and anode were ~3mm2. The detailed fabrication process was described elsewhere [14]. Fig. 1\n                      shows the schematic configuration of the measurement cell. A LSGM tape was supported on a LSGM ring that is again glass-sealed to an alumina tube. In order to test the reaction of LSGM with Ni, NiO was painted on the sintered LSGM films (t ~20μm) and fired at 1300, 1350, 1375 and 1400°C respectively. After firing, the NiO-coated LSGM films were pulverized and the powders were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu-Kα radiation (MAC Science, M18XCE, Japan) for the phase identification. The cells were electrochemically characterized at 700°C with 97% H2\n                     +3% H2O (flow rate ~30cc/min) as a fuel gas and open air as an oxidant gas. The electrochemical interface (Solatron, SI 1287, UK) and impedance analyzer (Solatron, SI 1260, UK) were used to obtain impedance spectra. The Ohmic resistance of the electrolyte was estimated from the high-frequency intercept of impedance curves. The current versus cell potential was measured and the microstructure was observed using an electrochemical interface (SI 1287) and a field-emission scanning-electron-microscope (JEOL, model 3330F, Japan), respectively. Elemental analysis was also performed by using a FE-SEM equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system (EDS) to investigate the reaction with Ni and the electrolyte.",
    "Results and discussion": "3\n                  Results and discussion\n                  \n                     Fig. 2\n                      shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the cell before anode reduction. The thick-film LSGM is ~20μm thick and nearly pore free. It is sandwiched between a porous SSC cathode and porous NiO-GDC anode layers. Although both the cathode and the anode electrodes were brush painted, the variation of thicknesses was not large. The thicknesses of cathode and anode were ~10 and ~20μm, respectively. A good adhesion was also shown between the LSGM electrolyte and the electrodes.\n                  \n                     Fig. 3\n                      shows the XRD patterns of sintered LSGM electrolytes after reaction with NiO after firing at different temperatures. LSGM thick-films, coated with the NiO slurry, were fired at 1300, 1350, 1375 or 1400°C, respectively. A LaNiO3 phase was found for the cells fired at or above 1350°C. In other words, there was a negligible reaction product detectable by XRD for the cell fired under 1350°C. The results explain the OCV values of the cells as discussed in the coming section. There was a negligible OCV drop for the cells with the anode sintered under 1350°C.\n                  In order to evaluate the contribution of Ohmic and interfacial polarization resistances, the impedance of the cells was measured at 700°C under open-circuit conditions. The Ohmic resistance (ROhm) and polarization resistance (RP) values of the cell were extracted from the impedance spectra. The influences of the anode-firing temperature on the ROhm and Rp are shown in Fig. 4\n                      where an area-specific resistance was plotted versus the anode-firing temperature. The results indicate that the RP values are dominant over the ROhm for all cells regardless of the anode-firing temperature. Due to the thin (t ~20μm) electrolyte layer, the portion of the ROhm value to the total resistance was small. If the thickness of the electrolyte increases over ~200μm, a typical thickness of the conventional electrolyte-supported SOFCs, the ROhm value will become ~10 times larger than the present value and thus will dominate over the RP value. The ROhm gradually increases with the increase in the anode-firing temperature. This observation indicates the increasing reaction between the anode and the electrolyte with increasing temperature. An insulating, LaNiO3 phase appeared with the increase in the anode-firing temperature. The LaNiO3 peaks appeared in the XRD patterns at or above 1350°C. It is expected that the formation of LaNiO3 induces either a composition change in LSGM or at least one additional phase for mass balance. LaSrGa3O7 is an example of the phase detected in the NiO-LSGM composite after sintering at 1400°C [17]. However, such a phase was not observed in this study due possibly to the detection limit of XRD. The formation of the insulating phase is considered as the main reason of the increase in the Ohmic resistance. Although the Rp value of the cell gradually increased when the anode-firing temperature increased from 1300 to 1375°C, it slightly decreased at 1400°C. Zhang et al. [11] reported that the LSGM (t ~500μm) cell with the Ni-SDC (Sm-doped ceria) anode sintered at 1350°C showed a large increase in the Rp. However, there was no significant increase in this study. The difference is not clear. However, the decrease in the Rp with the increase in the electronic conduction of the electrolyte is not unreasonable. The polarization resistance normally decreases with the increase in the electronic conduction of the electrolyte. The OCV of the LSGM cells also gradually decreased with increasing anode-firing temperature due to the appearance of electronic conduction in the LSGM electrolyte.\n                  The cell voltage and the corresponding power density values at 700°C are shown in Fig. 5\n                      as a function of the current density for the cells with different anode-firing temperature. These results clearly indicate that the power density values depend strongly on the anode-firing temperature. The OCV of the cells under air/97% H2\n                     +3% H2O gradient was 1.10, 1.03 and 0.90V for the cells with the anode fired at 1300, 1350 and 1375°C, respectively. The OCV value apparently depends on the anode-firing temperature and the extent of the Ni reaction with the LSGM electrolyte since Ni in LSGM induces an electronic conduction in the electrolyte and thus decreases OCV. The values of the Pmax (maximum power density) were 0.93, 0.83 and 0.55W/cm2 for the cells with anodes fired at 1300, 1350 and 1375°C, respectively. These results show that we can achieve a high performance for the electrolyte-supported cell at the intermediate temperature. The Pmax values of the current cells were comparable to the best performance (0.65–0.91W/cm2 at 700°C) of the anode-supported SOFCs using the LSGM electrolytes with thickness of 10–25μm. [12,13]. In this study, the LSGM electrolyte and anode were not co-fired and thus the sintering temperatures of the electrolyte and the anode were controlled independently. On the other hand, the anode-supported cells in the reported data were co-fired at 1400°C using a buffer layer such as the La-doped ceria to suppress the reaction between LSGM and the Ni-containing anode. However, the use of the buffer layer increases the complexity of the cell manufacturing process, the total thickness of the electrolyte, and thus the instability and the cost of the cell.\n                  The influences of the anode-firing temperature on the OCV and Pmax are shown in Fig. 6\n                     . The OCV and Pmax values of the cells gradually decreased with increasing anode-firing temperature. The anode fired at 1400°C showed the lowest OCV (~0.27V) due possibly to the severe diffusion of Ni from the anode to the electrolyte film. The diffusion of Ni from the Ni-GDC anode into the LSGM electrolyte was observed by EDS analysis. We found that Ni diffusion becomes more severe with the increase in the anode-firing temperature. The EDS line profiles of the cell with anode fired at 1400°C are shown in Fig. 7\n                      as an example. Although the Ni penetration into the 20μm-thick LSGM layer was shown mostly in the ~4μm-thick interface region, the electronic conduction path was apparently established through the electrolyte layer as shown by the decreased OCV. Although the cell with the anode fired at 1375°C showed a slightly reduced OCV (~0.90V at 700°C) compared to the Nernst potential, the performance was still reasonably high (Pmax ~0.55W/cm2 at 700°C). Thus, the maximum temperature of anode firing that does not severely reduce the cell performance is 1375°C.",
    "Conclusions": "4\n                  Conclusions\n                  A thick-film electrolyte-supported cell was useful to determine the optimum co-firing temperature of the anode-supported cells or to test the effects of the anode-firing temperature on the performance of the LSGM-based cells. The firing temperature of the Ni-GDC anode was the key factor that determines the performance of the LSGM-electrolyte film (t ~20μm)-supported cell. The cell with the anode fired at 1300°C showed the highest OCV (~1.1V at 700°C ) and the best performance (~0.93W/cm2). Although the cell with the anode fired at 1375°C showed a slightly decreased OCV (~0.90V at 700°C), the performance was still reasonably high. In order to avoid the use of the buffer layer, co-firing at or below 1375°C is recommended for the preparation of the anode-supported cell."
