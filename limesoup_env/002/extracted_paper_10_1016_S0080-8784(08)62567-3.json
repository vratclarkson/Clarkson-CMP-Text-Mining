  "abstract": "Facilitization for chemicalâ€“mechanical polishing (CMP) evokes many different images depending on the perspective of the user. This chapter discusses facilitization for CMP along with the steps involved in the process, such as slurry handling, slurry blending, piping systems, agitation, metrology, filtration, system maintenance and cleanup, and waste disposal. A slurry distribution system is a part of the infrastructure of a semiconductor fab, rather than a stand-alone piece of equipment. The chapter presents various key items for CMP slurry distribution system and discusses slurry dispense engines. CMP slurries are shipped to user sites in ready-to-use strength or as a concentrate, which must be diluted to use strength or mixed with one or more chemicals to create the final CMP polishing slurry. Ready-to-use slurries require no blending. There are different approaches to measure slurry constituents such as volumetric, weight scale, flow meter times time, metering pump times strokes, slurry mix ratio parameter endpoint, and point of use mixing. The chapter discusses the piping systems, its variations, and its material of construction.",
