  "abstract": "The understanding of post-chemical–mechanical polishing (post-CMP) cleaning processes requires some basic knowledge of electrochemistry and colloid sciences. With the decrease of device dimensions, planarization of both front- and back-end layers by CMP is imperative for technologies smaller than 0.5 μm. CMP applications, currently, concern both front-end steps such as shallow trench isolation (STI) and intermetal dielectric (IMD) in the back end of the line. For more advanced technologies where the damascene structure is adopted, outcropping metals such as aluminum, copper, tungsten, titanium, titanium nitride, tantalum, and tantalum nitride may be present with the silicon oxide. The behavior of these metals must be checked in the actual device configurations because of the simultaneous presence of two different metals—conductor and diffusion barrier—that induce different electrochemical potentials.",
