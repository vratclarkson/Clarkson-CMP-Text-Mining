  "abstract": "Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) has emerged as a critical step in integrated circuit fabrication for achieving global surface planarization of various thin films in the front- and back-end processing. This has led to the development of novel and advanced post-CMP cleaning techniques that can effectively remove different types of contaminants (e.g., particulate, organic, metallic, etc.) from surfaces. There is an increasing effort toward improving the fundamental understanding of the interfacial phenomena and the underlying physical and mechanical mechanisms that drive the post-CMP cleaning process. In this chapter, a review of batch- and single-wafer brush and megasonic cleaning processes with emphasis on the effect of different process variables on particle removal is provided. The first few sections briefly describe the forces that drive particle adhesion and removal in a post-CMP cleaning process. The last part of the chapter focuses on the typical chemical formulations and the role of additives in post-CMP cleaning of silicon dioxide, tungsten, and copper films.",
