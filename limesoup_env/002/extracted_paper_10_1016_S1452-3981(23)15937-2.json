  "abstract": "A novel method for machining reaction-sintered silicon carbide (RS-SiC) ceramic using anodically oxidation-assisted polishing is proposed. Through anodic oxidation of RS-SiC, hardness of the oxidized sample can be reduced, and the soft oxide layer is easy to be machined with the assistance of abrasive polishing. In this way, fine surface quality and high material removal rate can be obtained in machining RS-SiC. The influences of process conditions on the oxide morphology, oxidation rate, and surface roughness have been qualitative investigated with scanning electron microscope (SEM) and quantitative analyzed with scanning white light interferometry (SWLI). The results show that anodic oxidation of RS-SiC by phosphoric acid (H3PO4) under the constant potential can obtain soft oxide and smooth morphology; abrasive polishing of oxide layer can obtain smooth surface with roughness rms 8.520nm. Relationship between oxidation depth and its influencing factors can be theoretical analyzed based on the oxidation mechanism, and the oxidation depth can be calculated by hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching of the oxidized sample. It can be concluded that the anodically oxidation-assisted polishing, which includes the anodic oxidation of RS-SiC by H3PO4 and abrasive polishing of oxide layer by ceria slurry, can be treated as a practical method to machine RS-SiC.",
